## ⚔️ Knight’s Quest — My Life’s Work in Code

Knight’s Quest is my primary focus and the heart of my GitHub.  
Every system, every UI component, every pixel is part of building a world that feels immersive, readable, and ethically designed.

### What I’m building inside Knight’s Quest
- A clean, responsive UI with a handcrafted medieval aesthetic  
- A scalable architecture for campaigns, achievements, and progression  
- A fair, transparent ruleset with no pay‑to‑win mechanics  
- A drag‑to‑pan world map for immersive navigation  
- Modular content pipelines for future expansions and lore
